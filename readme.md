# Add some description of the plugin and how to use it here.

### To use this boilerplate, find and replace these strings:
* `PACKAGE_NAME_GOES_HERE` (format: `CARES_Data_Tools`)
* `PLUGIN_SLUG_GOES_HERE` (format: a url-friendly slug, most likely, like `cares-data-tools`)
* `PLUGIN_PREFIX` (useful for prefixing function names and similar, like `cdt`)
* `PLUGIN_AUTHOR_NAME`


// Exporting BP Docs from a group into a new site (and no longer associated with a group.)

Complications:
// The users must be imported.
// Attachments mst be imported.
// Maps and reports need to be reformatted to work with the new in-site tools.

// Getting an export file from CC.
